# HTMX + Appwrite Todo App

A modern, real-time todo application built with HTMX and Appwrite. This demo showcases how to build a fast, lightweight web application with minimal JavaScript using HTMX for dynamic interactions and Appwrite as a backend service.

## Features

- ‚ö° Real-time updates using HTMX
- üîí Secure backend with Appwrite
- üé® Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- üöÄ Fast and lightweight - no JavaScript required!
- üê≥ Docker support for easy deployment
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- üîê Document-level security with user ownership
- ‚úèÔ∏è Inline editing with optimistic UI
- üéØ Intuitive hover interactions on desktop

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10 or higher
- An Appwrite account and project
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- pip (Python package manager)

## Appwrite Setup

1. Create a new project in [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Create a new database
3. Create a collection with the following schema:
   ```
   content (string, required)
   ```
4. Enable Document Security in the collection settings
5. Create an API key with the following permissions:
   - databases.collections.read
   - databases.documents.read
   - databases.documents.write
   - databases.documents.delete
   - users.read
   - users.write

6. Note down the following values:
   - Project ID
   - API Key
   - Database ID
   - Collection ID

## Security Model

The application implements a robust security model:

- User Authentication:
  - Secure registration and login system
  - Session-based authentication
  - Automatic session cleanup on logout

- Document Security:
  - Each todo item is owned by its creator
  - Users can only see their own items
  - Document-level permissions using Appwrite's security rules
  - Automatic permission validation on all operations

## User Interface

The application features a responsive design that works well on both mobile and desktop:

- Desktop:
  - Clean, minimal interface
  - Action buttons appear on hover
  - Smooth transitions and animations
  - Intuitive edit and delete controls

- Mobile:
  - Touch-friendly interface
  - Always-visible action buttons
  - Compact header design
  - Optimized spacing and typography
